# ngGuidelines

*Angular guidelines and tooling*

One of the purpose is to describe global guidelines to follow for Web Applications using Angular.js.
But it is also made to describe the entire flow of the application, from packaging to deployment.

# Tools
 - Node.js
 - Bower.js
 - Grunt.js
 - jsHint (Is this really a tool ?)
 - ngAnnotate (In grunt ?)
