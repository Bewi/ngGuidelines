## Application Structure

When talking about Application Structure, there is multiple possible approach.

The chosen one is the *Folder By Features* over *Folder By Type*.

*Why ?* : 

- Easier to locate files 
- Purpose of each part of the application becomes obvious
- Make the application more scalable
- Easier to maintain (Add, remove, move feature)

					
	




## Tooling
 - Node.js
 - Bower.js
 - Grunt.js
 - jsHint (Is this really a tool ?)
 - ngAnnotate (In grunt ?)
